load

This is a job manager (load leveler) that I wrote for myself for running many (independent) instances 
(with many different user-defined parameter ranges) of a relatively small program (numerical integration 
of a set of coupled ordinary differential equations) on a 4000+ node cluster.

It needs several other scripts, and I did also a significant amount of post-processing with further scripts.
